        Welcome to the platform ”Protect the women”. Our website is a place that will provide You a lot of useful information about taking the first steps and the necessary measures to prevent violence against women. On this platform You will be able to receive advice, support, and encouragement for your further struggle at any time of the day or night.
Victims of violence often feel humiliated, helpless and guilty. They believe that no one understands them and that they are dealing with their problems alone. No one understands You better than those who have gone through a similar experience. Here You will be able to read the experiences of our brave women who have resolutely stood up to their abusers and dared to build their lives from scratch. Our website also allows You to share Your experience completely anonymously, which may encourage another young woman to stand up for herself and confront the abuser. 
We believe that united women can do anything they want, and that's exactly what our mission is; to encourage, empower, and restore faith and hope for a better tomorrow.
Vision of our community is a society with zero tolerance for violence in which all women, girls and children feel protected.
